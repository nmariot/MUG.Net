# Code of Conduct - MUG.Net Nantes
This code of conduct outlines our expectations for participants within the Meetup, as well as steps to reporting unacceptable behavior. We are committed to providing a welcoming and inspiring community for all and expect our code of conduct to be honored. Anyone who violates this code of conduct may be banned from the community.

We are dedicated to providing a harassment-free user group/conference experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, national origin, race, age or religion.

Our aim is to foster a community that is open to all and strives to:

* Be friendly and patient
* Be welcoming: We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds and identities.
* Be considerate
* Be respectful: We may not agree with each other all the time but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners.
*We expect all the community members to follow these rules at all the events organized by the MUG.Net Group.

If you are being harassed or notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact :

* for virtual events : the organizers in-person through meetup messages.
* for in-person events : the organizer present during the event
